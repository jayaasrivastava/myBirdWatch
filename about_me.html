			<p>I am a research scholar at IIT Bombay. After graduation, I worked in IT industry for three years and before the monotony and mediocrity of the job could set in, I quit and started my career as a researcher. Life has been colorful ever since, and I owe it all to the beautiful campus of which I am a fortunate resident.</br>
<p>A member of our faculty describes IIT Bombay campus as 'Monastery, Sanctuary and Laboratory'. Truest in all senses, aside from excellence in academics, this campus houses a variety of flora and fauna that attracts naturalists from around the country. We have hills on one end of the campus that is frequently visited by leopards, and Powai lake that is home to a few crocodiles. Our campus is resident to about 190 bird species, and consequently, a haven for bird watchers. You will find several resources listing birds of IIT Bombay. BirdWatch is a blog documenting my bird sightings in campus and nature trails/hikes that I visited over the past few years in India. You will find better pictures and annotations in other bird resources, but I hope my blog has instilled the birder in you. So thank you for visiting this website.</p>
<p>You can also find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>
